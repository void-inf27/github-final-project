# Simple Interest Calculator

This project is a simple interest calculator.

## Description
The calculator computes simple interest based on the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period.

## Formula
Simple Interest (SI) is calculated using the formula:

SI = (P × R × T) / 100

Where:
- P = Principal amount
- R = Rate of interest
- T = Time period

## Example
If the principal is 1000, the rate of interest is 5, and the time period is 2 years:

SI = (1000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = 100
